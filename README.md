> [!NOTE]
> This project is currently in **refactoring**. I am planning to incorporate additional features, so the current state of the project reflects the progress made within one month.


> [!CAUTION]
> Since the database is currently deployed on Koyeb and it's on a free plan, I have to reset it every 50 hours. If you see an error reflecting the server not responding, it's probably caused by that.

> [!TIP]
> if you want to see the website deployed, click to [this link](https://uberly-app.vercel.app/) and enjoy it!

##  DEVELOPMENT IN LOCAL ‚öô

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure that you complete the back-end setup before starting the application firstly. Only after the back-end server is running, you will be able to get the URL from the console.
> This step is crucial for the front-end to communicate correctly with the back-end.


 ### BACK-END

1. In the back-end, you should change the PostgreSQL variables with your credentials:

```sh
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=*url*
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=*username*
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=*password*
```

Once it's all set up, start the application in the back-end!


<br> 


### FRONT-END 

1. After setting up the back-end server, you will see the Tomcat localhost URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080). Copy this URL and update the apiURL in your front-end code to make API calls to your local back-end server. Here‚Äôs an example:

```sh
apiURL = 'http://localhost:8080/api'
```

> [!TIP]
> In the various services, I've left a comment with the same example I've provided here, so it's easier to switch between local and deployed versions.


2. To set up the project in local, run the following commands in the terminal:
```sh
npm i
npm install gsap
npm install jquery & npm install --save-dev @types/jquery
npm install @auth0/angular-jwt
```

Next, simply run the command `ng s -o` to start the front-end and you're done!
